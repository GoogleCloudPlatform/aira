# Learning + Insights + Action = LIA

LIA is an open-source experiment created by [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) Education Engineers that was put together to help educators across the globe on identifying reading gaps among students of different ages in the process of learning how to read and interpret a text.

LIA was designed to be as simple and flexible as possible so that it could be easily integrated into whatever pre-existing pedagogical or administrative student information system in place. It allows organizations to easily bring student data into the system for out-of-the-box evaluation.

After applying an online test, thanks to Google Cloud's AI platform, LIA automatically classifies and scores student's reading performance into an analytical dashboard, allowing educators and the institution's internal crew to easily understand the evolution of students individually, per class, per region, per school, so on so forth.

If you or your organization have a scenario where measuring reading and interpretation is important, you're invited to try LIA. Below you can find the documentation that is going to guide you through the process of putting LIA to work.
